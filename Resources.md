## Introduction
**Code Review** is a Quality Assurance process during which a Reviewer is given another's code to check for errors that slipped by the programmer. The benefits of practicing code review goes far beyond the simple, "Hey you missed a semi-colon". With proper techniques and open communication channels this process allows for more experienced programmers to teach, through real-world examples, concepts, which cause confusion when discussing in more theoretical terms.

## Types of Code Review
1. **"Remote Sharing"** - Which refers simply to the practice of emailing code ready for review to a/some reviewer(s), and when reviewers have the time to review they make suggestions and comments through emails, making sure to note where in the source code the suggestions and comments are referring to .
...* These reviews can become very cluttered in no-time.
2. **Pair Programming** - Where two programmers are assigned to work together on the same project thereby allowing each to check the work of the other, this is very popular in companies to assist new employees into coding "their-way".
3. **Tool Assisted** - You rely on software, which being what it is has bugs itself, to see if the code you write has bugs and is written properly.

### Why Should You Do It?
* Because your code kinda sucks, its not your fault writing code is hard and it is impossible to write bug-free code.
* To give you the opportunity to look at more code. This allows you to refine your own skills by reviewing your peer's work, which in turn helps them to be a better programmer.
* To be able to recognize different coding styles, possibly adapting them into your own style.
* It **forces you to comment your code**, one of the areas we all lack significantly in is commenting and understanding our own code, and because we must have comments for each method, class, and everything in between to assist the reviewer's understanding we now have comments and hopefully a slightly better.
